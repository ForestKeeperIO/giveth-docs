## **Sage to Saddle**

aims to focus Native American youth on healthy lifestyle alternatives, rising above the poverty and substance abuse that they often live with. Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge‚Äôs horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.

This project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8‚Äì18 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena. Students of the program will be granted the opportunity to learn and grow while carrying on a traditional relationship with the very animal that made their ancestors‚Äô survival possible.

## **Conscious Medicine Collective**

dreams to create a one-of-a-kind psychedelic consciousness center. Manex Ibar and Victoria Ibar, partners and founders, intend to create powerful experiences to bring together creativity, music, art, and high-end healing. The intention is to gather medical practitioners and influencers together into a club that fosters innovation, problem solving, and creative solutions through the use of plant medicines, psychedelics, and consciousness programs. They seek funding to establish their center on 12 acres of land they already have purchased in the picturesque Basque Pyren√©es. Conscious Medicine Collective aims to bring magic, nature and wonder into an experiential club center that provides elevation of consciousness.

## **Trust Graphic Novel**

is a transmedia project by Blockchain Philanthropy Champion Anne Connelly and accomplished artist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya. Both a graphic novel and motion comic, it is set in a future African nation that tells the story of Moraa, a young woman who learns about blockchain and uses it to protect her homeland from cultural and ecological destruction. By using storytelling to educate readers about blockchain technology, they hope to inspire African youth to see a bright future and link them to the training to create it. Currently Anne and her team are partnered with groups in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. The book will cover the basics of blockchains and cryptocurrency, and provide resources and links to their African-based educational partners.

## **Bloom Network**

represents an international community of people and projects working toward regenerative cultures. Local Bloom hubs around the world grow participation in practices such as food security, local economies, celebrations of diversity, and art as cultural transformation. There are tens of thousands of initiatives solving major social and environmental problems, who are excluded from mainstream media and institutional finance because the way they work is naturally collaborative and polycentric. Three big picture goals the Bloom Network hopes to achieve are:

*   Inspire a billion acts of regeneration.
*   Build capacity and relationships across regenerative culture initiatives.
*   Transfer power and resources to decentralized networks.

Contributions made to their project will go towards ‚ÄúRegenerative Actions Ticker‚Äù on their homepage, DAO templates that local Bloom chapters can use to fund the coordination labor of actions and launch the ‚ÄúCall to Bloom‚Äù that will help 100+ local Blooms get started as centers of regenerative action in their cities.

## **Must Have Crypto**

is a Cryptocurrency project based out of Kenya led by Mutinda Kisio. The Project is about teaching the masses about Crypto while enabling them to earn a daily basic income. They have minted their own token and plan to use it to teach low income individuals and families about how to use cryptocurrency by providing a steady stream of airdrops up to a maximum of a 1000 addresses. Mutinda is seeking funding to back the value of the token and provide real value to the tokens that are being airdropped.

## **Diamante Bridge Collective**

is a group of land stewards in the Diamante Valley, Costa Rica working together to create collective foundational agreements and a local regenerative economy that includes digital currencies for the transparent and accountable recordkeeping of their exchanges. They are building bridges between communities and organizations, local and global cultures, property owners and skilled service providers who are committed to working together long term to care for their bio-region, their neighbors, and the community at large. The Diamante Bridge Collective functions as a hub of many physical nodes, connected via global networks of shared vision and missions with the goal of restoring, preserving and consciously stewarding surrounding lands and watersheds while living harmoniously within them in alignment with planetary values. Donations will help develop infrastructure systems to support growing communities. [Head over to their project on giveth.io to make a donation!](https://giveth.io/project/diamante-bridge-collective)
