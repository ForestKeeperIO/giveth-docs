Our highlighted updates from everything related to the Giveth Galaxy and the GIVeconomy 🌌

-   **ETHDenver** ⛰**:** It was a conference to remember.  Check out our favourite moments from ETHdenver 2022 in this  [Mega thread](https://twitter.com/Givethio/status/1508458566075703299) or read all in [our blog](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-at-ethdenver-2022-964aa457878c).
-   **GIVstream ⛲️**: “The GIVstream is like a crypto UBI-esque reward stream — a GIV/week flowrate that can only go up as you participate in the GIVeconomy.” Find out why we created this & how to get one in our recent [Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/Givethio/status/1506295461963083783) & [blog](https://medium.com/giveth/your-givstream-flow-into-the-future-of-giving-f6dcd3615eae)!
