title: Governance Process
---

Giveth Governance benefits from a robust design and utilizes several platforms to aggregrate and foster advice, consensus, signalling, voting  and all the other wonderful actions enabled by Web3 decision-making systems.

We can divide governance participants into three categories based on their possible actions and the platforms they can use to participate. They are **GIV token holders**, **rDAO members**, and **the greater community** (or simply, the community).


#### (Or skip to the <a href="#TLDR">**TL;DR**</a>)


## The Community
Being part of the community has no requirements. If you know about Giveth and want to get engaged then we welcome you openly with our highest of vibes and spiciest of memes.

The best place for formal conversations around Giveth take place on our [Discourse forum](https://forum.giveth.io/). Our forum invites a wide variety of topics for anyone to introduce in-depth discussion, however more importantly, this is the quintessential launchpad where any legitimate governance proposal must start from.

Anyone in the community can create a proposal, however there are some considerations to make:
- <a id="proposal">Proposals</a> ideally have a clearly defined intention that outlines actions to be taken, potential consequences and funds requested (if applicable).
-  We adhere to a [**Community Covenant**](./covenant) which is our main reference point for any disputes or contentions.
-  We use [**Advice Process**](./adviceProcess) to gather feedback and refine proposals.
- Proposals must remain on the forum, open for Advice Process, for a **minimum of 5 days**.

If all conditions have been met, including time requirements for Advice Process, proposals can move on into either the GIVgarden or the rDAO DApps for voting.  In order to participate in these DApps you must hold either GIV or rGIV, respectively. All Giveth Governance DApps are deployed on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network).

**If a proposal desires to skip or shorten the Advice Process,** in the case of financial urgency for example, they may do so while providing a written disclaimer and a reason for doing so on their proposal. Skipping or shortening the Advice Process decreases the chances of a proposal passing, **do so with great discretion!**

:::note
### Soft-Consensus
 We often use polls inside the forum or on Discord to get soft-consensus for preferred outcomes. It's acceptable to use these same methods for [informal or low-impact decisions](#Informal-Decisions). However, for formal proposals they must indicate a clear intended outcome to keep objectives as clear as possible. The on-chain voting systems we use do not support multiple-choice voting.*

## GIV Token Holder

GIV token holders can get involved in decision making via the <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0xb25f0ee2d26461e2b5b3d3ddafe197a0da677b98" target="_blank">GIVgarden</a>. It leverages [Conviction Voting](https://forum.giveth.io/t/conviction-voting/154) and [Tao Voting](https://forum.giveth.io/t/tao-voting-explained/155) systems to allow GIV token holders to create, signal and vote on proposals using their GIV tokens. Decisions made in here revolve around community funding requests and suggestions as well as any metagovernance modifications. To learn more [visit our documentation regarding the GIVgarden](../giveconomy/givgarden).

## rGIV Token Holder

This is a form of executive council held for trusted Giveth contributors. rDAO members hold nrGIV and use an [Aragon DAO deployment](https://xdai.aragon.blossom.software/#/nrgiv/) to create and vote on proposals using simple Yes/No voting mechanics. Anyone can make a proposal, but only nrGIV holders can vote. Proposals will remain open for voting for 3 days and must adhere to the Quorum and Support Required percentages or else it will fail. In order to get nrGIV you must be a regular contributor to Giveth for at least 3 months. nrGIV is distributed quarterly to eligible current contributors.

:::info
When the first tokens are minted for a quarterly nrGIV distribution, all eligible contributors have 1 month from that date to request tokens. After this period the round is closed and no more token requests will be accepted for this period. Eligible contributors will still be able to request tokens for the next token distribution.

Learn how to become a contributor (and get rGIV) in our [Giveth Basics document](https://www.notion.so/giveth/Giveth-Basics-bff76dceaec64839b73aa89ba2fb8be4).  
## Informal Decisions
Not all decisions require formal on-chain votes. There is room for making low-impact, agile decisions via a range of platforms that Giveth's community utilizes. For the most clarity we refer to the Covenant's section on [off-chain decision making](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/covenant/#off-chain):

> Giveth uses Advice Process as its primary practice for flat decision making to empower contributors with agency to move their cultural proposals forward. Advice Process is written in the Giveth documentation and promoted verbally in community calls. When a non-financial, no-code decision will likely affect a large part of the community, the use of off-chain voting using polls in the Discord or Forum is implemented. A decision is considered legitimate when it respects this covenant, is promoted to the awareness of the community and its results arenâ€™t challenged within 2 weeks.  

> Giveth community spaces, including the Giveth Forum, GitHub and Discord, as well as other off-chain forums that may emerge in the future, are expected to adhere to this covenant.

<h2 id="TLDR">TL;DR</h2>

1. Make a <a href="#proposal">proposal</a> on the Giveth <a href="https://forum.giveth.io" target="_blank">forum</a>.
    - Allow a minimum of 5 days for advice process.
2. Create a proposal in the DApp for on-chain voting; this should link to your forum proposal.
    - [GIVgardens](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0xb25f0ee2d26461e2b5b3d3ddafe197a0da677b98) for GIV token holders
    - [rDAO](https://xdai.aragon.blossom.software/#/nrgiv/) for nrGIV token holders
3. Wait for results.
4. Execute required actions.
