Giveth.io is a platform where you can easily support projects both with cryptocurrency and fiat that you ❤️. Or create your own project and accept funding from a worldwide audience.

## Sign in

In the top right corner you will see the `sign in` button. Currently you can sign in via two methods, either by *Tor.us* or *Metamask*. You must choose!

#### Tor.us Sign in
Click on the `Torus` under the sign in drop down menu. You will be given several options of different platforms you can sign in with (e.g., Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Discord, etc.) You can also use the simple email option, which will send you a one-time use code to your email. Follow the Torus prompt and you should find your way in easily.

#### Metamask Sign in
If you're unfamiliar with Metamask or don't already have a wallet, head on over to (https://metamask.io/), and get yourself set up with one! Once your wallet is setup, make sure your Metamask browser extension is enabled and up to date. Click the 'Metamask' option under the sign in drop down menu. You should then be prompted by the Metamask pop up to confirm your signature, and then you should be plugged in and good to go!

## Fill in your profile info
Once you've logged in, it's recommended you fill in some info about yourself. Transparency is a two-way street! In the top right corner you should find now the thumbnail of your account. Click on it, and then click on `My Account`, then `Edit Public Profile`, and fill in the fields given, and hit `SAVE`.
