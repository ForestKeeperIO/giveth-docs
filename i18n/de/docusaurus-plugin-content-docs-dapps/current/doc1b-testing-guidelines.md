This guide provides a framework for testing the [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) DApp.

Each use case has a corresponding issue (linked in the titles below) in our GitHub. These issues will be closed after testing each sprint and reopened for the following one. If you wish to take on testing a use case, please assign yourself to the issue for that sprint.

## Requirements
* User testing should be done on https://next.giveth.io - **Our staging environment is deployed on both Ropsten (Mainnet) and Gnosis Chain** (formerly xDai Network).
* Please use a modern browser. If you encounter a bug, please try the same thing with another browser. Please make an issue in any case, but tell us if the issue might be browser specific.
* Use issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-next/issues) for reports and feedback.

## Use Cases

The following actions are defined as core functionality. If one of these steps is buggy, that represents a critical error.

###  [Project Creator](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-2/issues/798)

This use case is partially automated to ensure functionality before changes are made. However, user testing is still required.

#### Create Project
* Project details
* Use rich text formats (bold, italics, quotes, headers, etc.), and ensure they render properly
* Embed videos or images, and ensure they render properly
* Location selection / global impact
* Category select
* Google maps selection
* Check that projects are all listed in "my projects"
* Check that projects show up on homepage*
* Deactivate/reactivate project


:::info
*Projects created on the DApp have an automatic "unlisted" Status, meaning they will not show up until their status is changed to "listed". Reach out to someone with the `Verification Team` role on the [Giveth Discord](https://discord.giveth.io) who can show you how to list your project on staging in order to continue testing.
:::

### [Donor](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-2/issues/799)

* Donate with different tokens: ETH and ERC-20 tokens on Ropsten (Mainnet) and xDAI, ERC-20 tokens on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)
* Donate with alternate wallets (other than sign in)
