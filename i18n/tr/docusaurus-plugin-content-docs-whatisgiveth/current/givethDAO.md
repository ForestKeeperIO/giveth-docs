## What is a DAO?

A DAO is an acronym for a **Decentralized Autonmous Organization**. In short it's a decentralized application programmed on the blockchain to facilitate governance and organization of an enterprise or community. DAO's take governance to the next level by allowing its members to transparently and equitably make decisions. Some exciting examples are being able to mint and distribute your own currency or tokens, creating proposals and facilitating voting processes. Each DAO is designed different so make sure you do your homework before jumping into one!

**What is Conviction Voting?**
Conviction Voting is a coordination module that allows communities governing a shared resource to choose priorities in a decentralized way. 

Let’s look at some of the properties of Conviction Voting:
* Voting is continuous, its much more like signaling.
* The emitter can change their “vote” anytime
* A fundamental property of this particular system is that votes grow stronger over time (as long as the vote is not changed).
