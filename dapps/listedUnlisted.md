In order to ensure the quality of projects on our DApp, we have implemented a processus for pre-screening projects before they are featured on the Giveth homepage. All new projects are initially **unlisted** until they are reviewed and approved by a Giveth Unicorn. Unlisted projects can still receive donations and can be accessed via the project's URL. However, only **listed** projects will appear on the Giveth homepage & projects page, and using our sort, filter and search functionalities.

Once reviewed and approved, listed projects will appear everywhere on the DApp! If a project does not meet the listed critera, the project owner will receive an email asking them to update the project. If the project owner updates their project, it will be reviewed again by our team.

If a project is reviewed and found to violate our **Terms of Use**, it will be **cancelled** immediately, and the project owner will be notified via email.

The following guide is intended to support project owners in creating high quality listings and to support Giveth Unicorns in the review process.


## Listed Projects
In order for a project to be approved and listed on the DApp, it must have the following:
- :heavy_check_mark: Clear project descriptions explaining who they are and what they want to do with the funds
- :heavy_check_mark: A unique or custom banner photo
- :heavy_check_mark: No violations of our [Terms of Use](https://giveth.io/tos)
- :heavy_check_mark: (Optional) Embedded photos, videos or legitimate external links
- :heavy_check_mark: (Optional) For open-source projects, a link to their repository

### Examples of Projects that pass "Listed" criteria

1. [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/the-giveth-community-of-makers): Unique photo, clear description, external links
<img alt='Giveth' src={useBaseUrl('img/verifiedproject.png')} />

2. [The Commons Simulator](https://giveth.io/project/The-Commons-Simulator:-Level-Up): Unique photo, clear description, embedded video, external links
<img alt='CommonsSimulator' src={useBaseUrl('img/verifiedproject2.png')} />

## Unlisted Projects
A project is likely to remain unlisted due to the following:
- :x: No project description
- :x: Vague project description
- :x: No unique or custom banner photo

However, in order to remain active, the unlisted project must still exhibit:
- :heavy_check_mark: No violations of our [Terms of Use](https://giveth.io/tos)

### Examples of Projects that do not pass "Listed" criteria



1. Giving your hands to help: Strange/vague description: "We want to do favours all over Canada"
<img alt='giving your hands to help: a project with a vague description' src={useBaseUrl('img/projectExamples/givingyourhands.png')} />

2. Pritesh
   - Very minimalistic description: "We are helping poor Bangladeshi people after the crash. We are giving out rice and clothes to people around us."
    - No clarity given in the details of what crash and the exact process for "giving rice and clothes"

## Cancelled Projects

Projects that are found to exhibit "unacceptable behaviour" and/or violate our [Terms of Use](https://giveth.io/tos) will be cancelled immediately, and an email will be send to the project owner.

### Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- :x: The use of violent or sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- :x: Trolling, insulting, derogatory, abusive or vulgar comments, and personal, political, or religious attacks
- :x: Public or private harassment
- :x: Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (including doxing)
- :x: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
