You can find the Github repository containing the [GIVeconomy](https://giveth.io) front-end at https://github.com/Giveth/liquidity-mining-dapp.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Prerequisites

- Yarn
- npm
- your own [Infura](https://infura.io/) nodes for Kovan Network and Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)
- your favourite code editor (We recommend VSCode)


## Getting Started

First you'll need to get a local copy on your machine. Clone the repository from github on your computer.

```
git clone git@github.com:Giveth/liquidity-mining-dapp.git
```

:::info
### Environment Variables
copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the values to your Infura nodes as well as your API key
:::


Then to run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Open up your code editor and you're ready to start!
