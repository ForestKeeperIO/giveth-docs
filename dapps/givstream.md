Welcome to the expanding GIViverse! The GIVstream aligns community members with the long term success of Giveth and the GIVeconomy. With the GIVstream, anyone who adds value to the GIVeconomy receives GIV continuously for up to 5 years from the GIVeconomy launch date. The GIVeconomy begins humbly, but as time passes, the GIViverse expands: More GIV becomes liquid is streamed to our community of GIVernauts.

All GIVstreams flow until December 23, 2026, at which point the GIVeconomy will be in full swing! [Watch your GIVstream flow](https://giveth.io/givstream).

## How it Works
At launch, 10% of the total token supply of 1 billion GIV will be liquid and distributed across the [GIVeconomy](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/). The rest supplies the GIVstream which flows for 5 years, releasing more liquid GIV every second. After the 5 year period, 100% of GIV tokens will be liquid.

The following table explains what percentage of GIV is liquid and distributed throughout the GIViverse, and which part is still yet to flow from the GIVstream.


|Date	|Liquid GIV	|GIV flowing from the GIVstream|
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
|Dec 24, 2021	|	10% | 	90% |
|Oct 24, 2022  |   25%	|   75% |
|Mar 15, 2024	|	50% |   50% |
|Aug 04, 2025   |   75%	|   25% |
|Dec 23, 2026	|  100%	|    0% |


## Your GIVstream Flowrate

<img width='85%' alt='flowrate counter' src={useBaseUrl('/img/content/giveconomy/flowrate.png')} />

Your GIVstream flowrate is the rate (GIV/week) at which your GIV becomes liquid. All recipients of the [GIVdrop](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givdrop) will also receive a GIVstream on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network). If you did not receive a GIVdrop, you can still get a GIVstream by participating in the GIVeconomy.

You can get (or increase) your GIVstream flowrate on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network) by donating (on Gnosis Chain or Mainnet) and getting [GIVbacks](https://giveth.io/givbacks), by wrapping GIV to use in the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden), or by staking in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm) on Gnosis Chain.

You can get (or increase) your GIVstream flowrate on Ethereum mainnet by providing mainnet liquidity and staking GIV or LP tokens in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm) on Mainnet.

### Earning Rewards
When you earn GIV through participation in the GIVeconomy, part will be liquid and part will add to your GIVstream flowrate. As time passes and the GIVstream flows, a greater percentage of the total GIV you earn is liquid.

When you earn and/or claim rewards from GIVbacks (Gnosis Chain), the GIVgarden (Gnosis Chain) or the GIVfarm (Gnosis Chain or Ethereum Mainnet), you increase your GIVstream flowrate. Note that when you claim, any GIV liquid from the GIVstream on that chain also get sent to your wallet.

### History Table

The GIVstream history table is a summary of all the instances in which your GIVstream flowrate increased. When GIVbacks are distributed, the increase in your flowrate is automatically added to the history table. For rewards earned in GIVfarm, you must "harvest" in order to see your GIVstream flowrate increase, and to see the corresponding entry in the history table.

Note: When earning rewards in the GIVfarm, it does not matter if you harvest rewards and increase your flowrate sooner, or later. You total liquid rewards and streaming rewards will be the same in either case.

----

The GIVstream nurtures the GIVeconomy at inception by having only 10% of the total supply of GIV liquid and transferrable to start. As the GIVeconomy grows & stabilizes, more GIV becomes liquid and available for everyone. We want to empower those who support the Giveth ecosystem with steadily increasing governance rights, this includes participants who:
- [Donate to Verified Projects](https://giveth.io/projects)
- Vote in the [GIVgarden](https://giveth.io/givgarden), and
- Provide liquidity in the [GIVfarm](https://giveth.io/givfarm)

Participants benefit from their GIVstream flowing as the GIVeconomy flourishes over time, therefore we ensure that Giveth is not just governed by people who buy tokens on the open market but by those who contribute in a more meaningful way.
