This is a guide for thorough user testing scenarios for the GIVeconomy DApp. Testing should be done on the staging server which can be found at https://staging.giveth.io/.


## Requirements

* Please use a modern browser. If you encounter a bug, please try the same thing with another browser. Please make an issue in any case, but tell us if the issue might be browser specific
* Use issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth/GIVeconomy/issues) for reports and feedback.

## Use Cases

The following actions are defined as core functionality. If one of these steps is buggy, that represents a critical error.

### General

- Buttons on "Overview" page are responsive
- Tabs `GIVgarden`, `GIVfarm`, etc.. are responsive
- Navbar Header buttons are responsive
- Can successfully sign in on Navbar with Web Wallet (currently optimized for MetaMask)
- Footer links are working and link correctly

### GIVfarm
The GIVfarm staging deployment uses both Gnosis Chain and Kovan (Mainnet) Network. The token used for this deployment is *DRGIV3*:
- `0x83a8eea6427985C523a0c4d9d3E62C051B6580d3` on Gnosis Chain
- `0x29434a25abd94ae882aa883eea81585aaa5b078d` on Kovan

Test tokens used for providing liquidity on Gnosis Chain are as follow:
- Gnosis Chain TestHNY: `0x69F79C9eA174d4659B18c7993c7EFbBbB58cF068`
- Gnosis Chain TestWETH:`0x736a98655049433f79dCcF5e54b887E8890b63D1`  

On Kovan, regular Kovan ETH is used for providing liquidity and paying gas.

## GIVbacks

To learn how to create a test GIVback distribution, contact a Developer or mitch (divine_comedian#5493) on Discord to help you.

You'll have to make a legitimate donation to a verified project on Giveth.io in order to test GIVbacks with your own Ethereum Address.

 Once you have executed a test distribution you can verify a few pieces of the `GIVbacks` page:

:::info
GIVbacks are only available on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network).
:::

- Verify your GIVbacks Reward amount, checking that the calculations align with the donations you made to a verified project during your defined GIVbacks period.
- Your GIVbacks claimable amount should be a set amount (not increasing like GIVfarm rewards).
- Your GIVbacks streaming amount should be in the GIVstream history table at the time of GIVbacks distribution.
- Harvest GIVbacks is successful.
- `DONATE` and `VERIFY` buttons work.

## GIVstream
The GIVstream is available on both Gnosis Chain and Kovan. Make sure you have pending farming rewards on both networks to fully test the GIVstream.

-Gnosis Chain/Ethereum Network toggle works
- Buttons for `PROJECTS`, `PROPOSALS`, `OPPORTUNITIES` and `LEARN MORE` work.
- Can Harvest GIVstream rewards in the top right modal on both Gnosis Chain and Kovan.
- `?` image on GIVstream rewards modal shows pop-up when clicked, links and button within modal are functional
- '?' hover tooltips work
- `GIViverse Expansion` displays correctly (if it's 0% that's bad.)
- `Time remaining` shows correctly (GIVstream ends on December 23, 2026)
- GIVstream flowrate increases are shown in the history table. GIVfarm rewards should appear in the table after claiming from the GIVfarm. GIVbacks rewards should appear in the table at the moment of GIVbacks distribution.
