## Find a project that you like.
Have a good look at the projects already created, read the descriptions, and do your homework! 

You can browse projects through different categories and sort them by [GIVpower](./GIVpower.md) rank or other options.

Once you found a project you would like to donate to, hit the `DONATE` button.

## Select how you want to donate your funds.
Once you're at the donation page, you need to select if you want to make your contribution in crypto or fiat currency.

#### Crypto Donations
We accept ETH and a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens on both Mainnet and Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network). Choose the amount of cryptocurrency you would like to donate. Once you've entered the amount you can click on `DONATE`, at which point your wallet will prompt you to validate the transaction. If you would like to use a different wallet than the one you use to sign into your account, click on `change wallet` in the drop down menu in the top right of the homepage.

When the transaction has been signed off and processed, you're done! Nice work! You'll be taken to the confirmation page, and you can track the transaction details by following the link on the page.
