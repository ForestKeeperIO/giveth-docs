The [Giveth Matching Pool](https://giveth.io/project/Giveth-Matching-Pool-0) is raising funds for future donation matching to [verified projects](https://docs.giveth.io/dapps/projectVerification/) on Giveth! It is a one-stop-shop for donors who want to ensure their donation has a broad impact.

Our [vision](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/) for the Future of Giving is a world in which giving is effortless and people are rewarded for making positive change. **Give to donation.eth, make a difference for public goods, and get rewarded with **[**GIVbacks**](https://medium.com/giveth/what-if-giving-gave-back-using-web3-to-evolve-philanthropy-a8500b7636ce)**.**

Donations to this project on any of our supported chains (Mainnet, Gnosis, Optimism and Polygon) are eligible for GIVbacks, and 100% of the funds collected will be distributed to verified projects on Giveth. *Note: only donations in tokens on the *[*GIVbacks token list*](https://forum.giveth.io/t/givbacks-token-list/253)* are eligible for GIVbacks.*

The recipient of this project is our donation.eth multisig, a 7/15 multisig managed by core Giveth team members.

We plan to distribute the funds raised by this project based on 2-week quadratic funding rounds on Giveth.io (expected to launch mid-2023). Project eligibility for each QF round will vary, and we will keep you posted about eligibility requirements and other round details as we have them!
