We'll walk you through the process of making a crypto donation via Metamask here. If you do not have a Metamask wallet, well, then you should [head on over to the Metamask website, and learn how to get one!](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-Started-With-MetaMask)

### How to Make a Donation

Once you have chosen a project and set an amount to donate, go ahead and click the `DONATE` button. This should bring up a pop-up window confirming the amount to donate.

 If the amount is right, click on `DONATE`. A pop-up window from Metamask to confirm the transaction details will be shown.

Verify that the amount on the Metamask pop-up corresponds with the amount you specified on the project page. Take note that the gas fee from the network you are donating in will be added on top of the donation amount. Make sure you have enough tokens in your wallet to cover the gas fees, otherwise the transaction cannot be completed.

 If it looks good, hit `CONFIRM`, and your donation transaction will begin. You should see a pop-up that looks like this:

You can check your transaction in the transaction pop up on your Metamask under the 'Activity' Tab. 

Once the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain, you'll be taken to the next page confirming your successful donation. Nice work!
