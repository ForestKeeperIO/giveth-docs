## Contemplate the vision for your project
Think about the project that you want to create: do you have concrete goals? What are you asking for funding for? Can you explain your project and your intentions clearly?

Discover the ins and outs of the project creation process with our detailed demonstration in the [Project Owners 101 video course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Artm1rmCWFi-qEkOtjl9nL4tojSIIKm&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE).

## Editing my project after it's been published
If you made a mistake or need to change something on your project, it's super simple to go back and update it. If you're on the homepage, go to the top right, and click on your account, then select `My Projects`. Once you're there, you should see a page of your projects; hover over the project you wish to edit, then click the `EDIT` button. You should see your project's contents; you can scroll through and change the content you wish, and once you're done, just hit save!
