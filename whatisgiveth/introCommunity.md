**COMMUNITY…** has always been the foundation of Giveth, the sum of all parts.

**COMMUNICATION…** is the glue that holds these parts together.

**COMMONS…** is the publicly accessible resources that are shared, cultivated and managed together.

## Welcome to the Giveth Community Circle!

This circle is held down by the Communications team yet comprised of representatives from the other two Circles, as well as various working groups that may form. Here is where new contributors, project owners, campaign managers, collaborators, conspirateurs, catalysts and really all the cool cats come to play, learn, give and grow.

## Mission

Our mission is to be the living and breathing core of Giveth, an ecosystem of collective support, abundance and communication where we cultivate relationships and assist innovative projects with a focus on blockchain4good. We connect Givers and Makers with the Giveth Community through transparent, intentionally crafted and clearly communicated stories and resources.

## Goals

* **Build Community around For-Good Projects** by nourishing relations between Givers, Makers and the greater community through meaningful engagement, outreach, trust facilitation and conflict resolution - creating a safe space for community members to communicate their passion projects, then recruit help or guidance from peers.
* **Offer a Clear & Supportive Onboarding Process** as Giveth develops the Dapps, economy, DAO and ongoing new features. The community circle provides a well-defined, transparent and helpful onboarding process that supports the needs of Contributors, Communities, Campaigns, Projects and Donors as well as functions as a bridge for newcomers into the crypto space.
* **Coordinate External and Internal Communications** when broadcasting or sharing activity and development progress externally through the Giveth channels and social media - ensuring that the voice of Giveth as an organization is aligned with our overarching Values, Vision, Mission and Goals and that all Giveth Circles are represented.
* **Create a Network of Partners** by way of collaboration, relationship building and support of common goals with various strategic partner organizations as well as community members focused on blockchain4good and improving the ethereum commons - providing resources, education and sharing of best practices.
*Partners currently include communities like [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/), [TEC](https://forum.tecommons.org/), [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/), [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/), [1Hive](https://about.1hive.org/), [Panvala](https://panvala.com/), [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/) and [MetaGame](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/).*
