title: Giveth Community Covenant
---

The Giveth DAO is a self-governed organization dedicated to revolutionizing philanthropy and "Building the Future of Giving" by bridging the Ethereum and non-profit worlds. Giveth's mission is to build a culture of giving that empowers and rewards those who give - to projects, to society, and to the world.

Giveth envisions a future in which giving is effortless and people all around the world are rewarded for creating positive change. The Giveth platforms aim to be free for donors and projects, globally accessible and self-sustaining. Giveth aims to facilitate the efficient, transparent flow of funds directly to where they have the most positive impact.

The Giveth community [values](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/) decentralization, innovation, altruism, empowerment, trust, transparency and collaboration. This social layer is the foundation on which our DAO is built.

The growth of Giveth is directly related to the community's ability to foster an inclusive and welcoming culture that people feel proud and delighted to adopt as their own. When someone chooses to participate in the Giveth community, they are implicitly supporting the community's culture, values and norms.

Therefore, Giveth rests on an ever-evolving social contract, which sets expectations for how members should engage both with the protocol and with one another. The Giveth Community Covenant attempts to lay out this social contract. This Covenant first lays out our pledge to each other to make the Giveth community a welcoming and safe environment for everybody.  Second, the Covenant discusses the way both off-chain and on-chain decisions are made and how those decisions are judged to be successful.  As a community-driven DAO, the Covenant is subject to change via the community.  

## The Pledge
We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make participation in Giveth a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body shape, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that are in agreement with the [Giveth mission, vision and values](/whatisgiveth/), and contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

### Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: 
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people 
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences 
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback 
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, while learning from the experience 
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: 
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind 
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 
- Public or private harassment 
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (commonly called doxing)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## On-chain Decision Making

Giveth uses the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/giv.eth) voting platform to vote on impactful Organization decisions that are aligned with its [mission, vision and values](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/). 

Additional polycentric governance processes used by Giveth are specified in [this living document](/whatisgiveth/governanceProcess) and might change according to the community’s decisions.

## Off-chain Decision Making

Giveth uses an [Advice Process](/whatisgiveth/adviceProcess) as its primary practice for flat decision making to empower contributors with agency to move their cultural proposals forward. Advice Process is written in the Giveth documentation and promoted verbally in community calls. When a non-financial, no-code decision will likely affect a large part of the community, the use of off-chain voting using polls in the Discord or Forum is implemented. A decision is considered legitimate when it respects this covenant, is promoted to the awareness of the community and its results aren’t challenged within 2 weeks. 

Giveth community spaces, including the Giveth [Forum](https://forum.giveth.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/JxF38Tj364), as well as other off-chain forums that may emerge in the future, are expected to adhere to this covenant.

## Enforcement

Giveth intends to use [Gravity Conflict Management](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-general-process/173) and make use of its graduated sanctions in order to ensure community standards.
