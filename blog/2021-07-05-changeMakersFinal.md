Giveth has been buzzing with action! While we‚Äôve been hard at work behind-the-scenes building for our community, Giveth change-makers have been hard at work creating positive impact on the ground. We are excited to share with you one final round-up of projects in the Change-Maker Campaign.

Our [Calling All Change-Makers Campaign](/blog/changeMakers) launched in April 2021 as a way to highlight the unique stories of for-good projects on Giveth and bring extra attention to the work that they are doing to change the world for the better. Read on to discover the final submissions!

Perfect Village Communities (PVC) in Burundi
============================================

Is an organization that aims to improve the living conditions in rural communities across the central African country of Burundi. The project‚Äôs creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to **58% of children suffer from malnutrition** and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village‚Äôs commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.

PVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.

Food sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC‚Äôs healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch ‚ÄúCommunity Reconciliation‚Äù where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.

<img alt="Bridging Digital Communities" src={useBaseUrl('/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png')}  />

Bridging Digital Communities
============================

Is run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay. He creates online bridges that allow communities to stay connected. In the decentralized world of Blockchain, communities can spring up seemingly out of nowhere, forming around causes, concepts, technologies or protocols. In this rapidly growing part of the world wide web, communities thrive off of the collective innovation and synergy of ideas, exponentiated greatly by the digital bridges that Kay creates. He has been creating and maintaining bridge servers for applications such as Discord, Telegram or Riot and has never charged anyone to make these connections. He bridges quite a few notable Ethereum projects such as: Matic, Gitcoin, 1hive, Conensys, Aragon and even Giveth (Thanks Kay! üòâ)

Kay has a project on Giveth ‚Äî the proceeds of which go into funding the work he does building bridges and keeping digital communities connected. [Check out his project on Giveth here!](https://giveth.io/project/Bridging-Digital-Communities-1)

<img alt="Vegan Africa Fund" src={useBaseUrl('/img/blog/changeMakersFinal3.png')}  />

Vegan Africa Fund
=================

Is a Social Enterprise focused on creating a vegan economy in Africa. They actively support African ventures in education, regenerative agriculture, renewable-energy cryptocurrency mining, vegan leather and clothing, reforestation and making delicious vegan food! They have minted their own digital $VAF impact-tokens which are accepted by all of their affiliate businesses for any products, services and experiences they might offer. Vegan Africa Fund hopes to kick-start their green economy with initial funding to back their $VAF token.

<img alt="Spread the Love Commission" src={useBaseUrl('/img/blog/changeMakersFinal4.png')}  />

Spread the Love Commission
==========================

Bridges the divide in the US between those experiencing homelessness and the inspired individuals who want to lend a hand. Wren Fialka, the founder, started it all by asking a man experiencing homelessness one question: ‚ÄúIf there was a bag of items that I could bring you tomorrow to make your day-to-day life easier, what would be in the bag?‚Äù. Based on their simple approach focused on ‚ÄúConnection, Compassion and Vital Supplies‚Äù they have been serving communities across the US for the last 6 years.

On the Spread the Love project page they state that anywhere between 600,000 to 1.5 million people experience homelessness across the country, and with Covid-19 financial support ending soon, that number is likely to rise. With only one employee, Spread the Love Commission needs to grow in order to meet these rising challenges. So far they have served over 30 communities and with Giver support they hope to serve many more.

Spread the Love Commission aims to remove the stigma of homelessness and connect those stuck in a vicious cycle with support from those who are ready to offer it. With sustainability, compassion and persistence they hope to end the homelessness crisis once and for all.

And that‚Äôs a wrap! Thank you to all the Givers that provide support to projects that are making a difference, and to all the change-makers that are finding a way to make positive global impact.
