_We‚Äôre back with another development update from our recent sprint cycle! Read on to stay in-the-know on what‚Äôs dAppening at_ [_giveth.io_](https://giveth.io/)

In this past sprint, we discovered in our testing a wee little bug in our ‚Äúsort‚Äù feature that was causing only the pre-loaded projects to be sorted. Rest assured, we squashed that bug and now the sort/filter/search functionality is working smoothly. We have documented how to obtain a project with a high ‚Äúquality score‚Äù in our [Giveth docs](https://docs.giveth.io/guides/qualityscore/). Makers can now ensure that they‚Äôre doing everything they can to see their projects rise to the top!

We‚Äôve upgraded the projects page as well with ‚Äúinfinite scroll‚Äù, allowing the user to scroll down the page as new projects load automatically.

To further improve upon the quality of projects on our dApp, our team has been working on the new project verification method. We are developing a process in which Makers can submit their projects for review by our team and potentially achieve ‚Äúverified‚Äù status. In the future, verified projects will be eligible for some exciting benefits üòâ

If you haven‚Äôt heard yet, we launched the ‚Äú[Change Maker Campaign](https://medium.com/giveth/calling-all-change-makers-7fa964684c2b)‚Äù with [#giveth4change](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giveth4Change?src=hashtag_click), encouraging Makers to creatively share their stories on how they are making a positive impact in the world we live in. Our favourite projects are going to be highlighted across the Giveth social network, helping them gain cred and support!

It runs until May 12, 2021, so it‚Äôs not too late to submit your projects!

Coming with our next sprint, we‚Äôll be putting the finishing touches on rich text formatting for project descriptions so Makers can add photos, embed videos, create lists, format texts, and customize the presentation of their project information.

We‚Äôre also continuing to improve email notifications so that our users get appropriate and useful emails in accordance with their interactions on Giveth.

Further adding to the dApp, we‚Äôll be integrating an embedded support chat so that users on giveth.io can ask questions directly to our team while using the platform.

Still in the works is the implementation of efficient methods of fiat on-ramping and off-ramping, and we now have more of our team members focusing efforts on resolving this long standing issue.
