We asked our community to add their projects to [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) and [share their stories](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) about how they are changing the world for the better using #giveth4change. Keep reading for our second round of submissions, or [submit your story](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) via [twitter](https://twitter.com/Givethio) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/) to be featured in our next round up.

Itâ€™s an absolute pleasure to have the opportunity to highlight another batch of great projects shaking things up out in the world! We have **four** awesome submissions for this period that we would like to share. Letâ€™s check them out:

## **The Commons Simulator**

is a gamified computation tool powered by a cadCAD backend that blends art and simulation into a choose-your-own-adventure sci-fi storyline. In the game, you travel back in time to use cadCAD as a tool to help a community design a regenerative Commons with the potential to save the world from total planetary and economic destruction. The first level is live and you can play it right now on [https://sim.commonsstack.org](https://sim.commonsstack.org).

Developed by the Commons Stack Dev community, the Commons Simulator illustrates one of the core missions of the Commons Stack: Empowering communities to design their own economies using open source simulation tools. Donations to this project on Giveth will go towards expanding the game by adding another level with a new story and new mechanics, such as the [Augmented Bonding Curve](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751).

<img alt="Njombe Beyond" src={useBaseUrl('img/blog/njombeBeyond.png')}  />

## **Njombe Beyond**


aims to tackle waste management challenges in Njombe, a town of 40,000 in southwest Tanzania. A common challenge in Tanzania is solid waste management, including in Njombe. Mettodo, the projectâ€™s creator states:

> â€˜ 35 tons of solid waste is generated daily by the town: 28 tons are taken to a dumpsite, where the waste is usually burned . . . 10 % of the solid waste is plastic waste: 3,500 kg of per day, which is equal to 1000 tons of plastic waste every year.â€™

Njombe Beyond is working hard to reduce the plastic wasted in Njombe town. Their three specific objectives are:

*   Establish a small scale value chain for recycling plastics within the local community.
*   Collaborate with stakeholders of the program and ensure fair working conditions.
*   Involve schools and local communities in Njombe Beyond to bring awareness to the problems and opportunities of plastic waste.

When we first set out on the change-maker campaign we had decided to wrap things up on the 12th of May, but after some discussion we have decided to **extend the change-maker campaign** indefinitely. Itâ€™s an amazing opportunity to engage with our community and celebrate the amazing projects happening on [Giveth.io](http://giveth.io). If youâ€™d like to learn how to participate [check out the original medium post](2021-04-15-change-makers.md) for more details on getting your project featured in our submission round-ups!
